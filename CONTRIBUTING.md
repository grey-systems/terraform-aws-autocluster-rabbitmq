Git Flow
--------
We chose to use the [Git flow branching model][flow] for `terraform-aws-autocluster-rabbitmq`, so you are
kindly required to follow the same model when making your contributions.  That
basically means that:

  * If you are fixing a bug, you can create a *hotfix* branch from the affected
  release (preferably, the latest one) and send a pull request from that branch.
  * If you are creating a new feature, please checkout the `develop` branch and
  send a pull request from there.
  * I won't consider pull request coming from the `master` branch and if I do, I
    won't be quick.
